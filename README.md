Crypto Quiz

Repo Link: https://github.com/charliem61/Crypto-Quiz
Live Url: https://charliem61.github.io/Crypto-Quiz/

Goal/Motivation:

    When the user logs onto the page, they will be presented with a series of questions in the form of a quiz to test their crypto knowledge.

    Upon completion of the quiz they will recieve a score from the recording of their answers at a 5 point value for each.


Problems Solved:

    A user will come to the page to simply test their knowledge of the prompted questions asked to the user. 

    The questions are then judged against a answer rubric to then be graded and returned to user with answers correct with 10 being the max answers recieved. 

The Standouts:

    I created a tough quiz I would say based on my love cryptocurrency, metaverses, and blockchain technology. I also prompted the user how and where to learn more about crypto upon completion of the quiz.
    
Challenges Faced:
    Learning this new matierial, taking the extra time to go review this matierial learned. I still continue to struggle with javascript. Working with several different ways to enter question and tie answer data.
